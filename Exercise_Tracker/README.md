Project: Database backed website that features Ajax interaction.

An exercise tracker that displays a table of completed exercises including various data fields such as date, name, reps, and weight. 
A form allows the user to input a new activity. The table has options to delete an activity or update it, which triggers another form 
to display for updating the information. This update form is pre-populated with the current data from the database.
